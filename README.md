# Fullstack Monorepo Starter

This is an early-stage fullstack playground project built to experiment with modern web technologies and architecture patterns.

The goal of this repository is to serve as a solid foundation for exploring advanced fullstack features such as:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Admin panels and dashboards
- CRM-like workflows
- E-commerce logic
- API-first development using tRPC

At this point, the application has no fixed domain or business logic â€” it will evolve over time as ideas and features are shaped.

## ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack

- **Backend:**
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
